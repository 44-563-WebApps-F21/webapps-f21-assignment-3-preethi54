    <h3>Code Display </h3>
    <p>Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in
        obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures. It is closely related to many other areas of
        mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to
        computer science, etc.</p>
